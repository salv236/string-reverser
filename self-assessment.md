# Self-Assessment

Now that you've finished building your solution, look back on the process you just went through.  What went well and what didn't go so well?
* How well did you estimate the time it would take?
* Were you able to understand and handle your bugs? Or better, were you able to avoid them?
* Did you repeat any mistakes you'd made in previous projects?
* Do you wish you'd chosen a different solution strategy?
* How helpful were the test cases you chose?
* Were your constraints helpful? too restrictive? distracting?
* How well were you able to determine what to scaffold?

Include a section with plans for how to improve your next CodeWars solution based on what you learned from this one.
